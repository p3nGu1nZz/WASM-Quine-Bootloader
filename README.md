# WASM Quine Bootloader

This project now supports configurable mutation heuristics and richer
telemetry output.  See `docs/specs/spec_heuristics.md` and
`docs/specs/spec_telemetry.md` for details.  CLI flags such as
`--telemetry-level`, `--mutation-strategy`, `--profile` and
`--max-gen` allow fine‑grained control of runs.  Under the hood the
application caches the decoded kernel bytes and instruction stream to
avoid repeated base64 work, and the build system enforces
`-Werror` so the codebase must remain warning-free.  The CLI also
prints stderr warnings when a flag value is unrecognised, setting a
`parseError` flag that wrapper scripts or tests can inspect.  DPI
scaling is computed automatically from the window size and is clamped
to a maximum of **2×** to prevent runaway fonts on enormous displays.

A self-replicating, self-evolving WebAssembly kernel visualizer — native **C++17** desktop application using **SDL3** and **Dear ImGui**.

For technical design details see **[docs/design.md](docs/design.md)** and **[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)**.

Specification documents live under `docs/specs/` (e.g. CLI, telemetry formats).

## Agent Skills

This repo includes a full suite of Copilot agent skills; see `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for a current list.  Key skills include:

- `setup-project`, `build-app`, `run-app`, `test-app`
- `update-docs`, `update-specs`, `update-skills`, `update-memory`
- `search-memory`, `telemetry-review`, `introspect-telemetry`
- `repo-facts` – deep dive into the repository and report its architecture, design and blockers.
- `improve-skills`, `improve-src`, `commit-push`
- `update-issues`  <!-- handles scanning open issues, closing implemented ones, and generating new tasks from code reviews -->

Agents can invoke them via natural language prompts; the skills and
instructions are maintained by the `update-skills`/`improve-skills` tools.
When told to "run" a skill the agent should execute its logic and make the
corresponding edits automatically rather than simply listing what could be
done.

Key skills now also include `code-review` for comprehensive reviews,
`improve-tests` for expanding the unit test suite, and `timed-run` for
shortcut experiment cycles with automatic telemetry analysis.  Workflow
prompts are stored under `.github/prompts/` and guide agent behaviour for
the master and development workflows.  The development prompt now also
offers an optional issue‑triage step: if the backlog is quiet it will run
`code-review` to produce new task candidates.

## Quick Start (Windows WSL2 / Ubuntu)

### Step 1 — Install dependencies and build

> **Note:** the CMake project now enables `-Werror` on GCC/Clang so any
> compiler warnings will be treated as errors.  Fix warnings before
> building or use `bash scripts/build.sh --clean` to reset.

The `setup.sh` script can also reset your workspace:

```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh --clean    # remove external/, bin/ and then run setup
```

This is useful if you want a completely fresh third-party checkout before
re-running the normal install steps.

```bash
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

By default the build scripts will pick up whatever C and C++ compilers are first on your `PATH` (for example `/usr/bin/gcc`/`/usr/bin/g++`).
If you are running under WSL and have a non‑default compiler installed (clang, a different gcc version, etc.), you can force the project to use it by exporting the standard environment variables **before** invoking `build.sh`:

```bash
# use g++-12 instead of the system default
export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-12
export CXX=/usr/bin/g++-12
bash scripts/build.sh
```

The `build.sh` helper now passes those overrides through to `cmake`; you can also pass them manually via `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER`/`-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` if you prefer.

This script will:
1. Install system packages (`build-essential`, `cmake`, `ninja-build`, SDL3 system deps, fonts)
2. Clone **Dear ImGui** → `external/imgui`
3. Clone **wasm3** → `external/wasm3`
4. Install or build **SDL3** for Linux → `external/SDL3/linux`
5. Build the `linux-debug` target → `build/linux-debug/bin/bootloader`

### Step 2 — Run

Keyboard shortcuts are available when using the GUI version:

- **Spacebar** – pause or resume the current kernel.
- **E** – export the current kernel/telemetry immediately.
- **F** – toggle fullscreen/windowed (useful when switching focus).
- **H** – log a help message summarising shortcuts.
- **Q** or **Escape** – quit the application.

The launcher also supports several command‑line options (see
`spec_cli.md` for full semantics):

- `--telemetry-level=<none|basic|full>` – control how much export data is
  written (header only, full report, or disabled).  The default is now
  **full** so that every run generates a useful history export without
  extra flags.
- `--telemetry-dir=<path>` – change output directory for reports.
- `--telemetry-format=<text|json>` – choose the export file format; JSON is
  easier for scripts to parse.
- `--mutation-strategy=<random|blacklist|smart>` – choose evolution
  policy; `blacklist` enables the adaptive heuristic.
- `--heuristic=<none|blacklist|decay>` – shorthand toggle for the heuristic;
  `decay` mode will gradually forget entries after each successful
  generation.
- `--profile` – log per-generation timing and memory usage.
- `--max-gen=<n>` – stop after `n` successful generations (handy for CI).
- `--max-run-ms=<n>` – exit once the bootloader has been running for roughly `n` milliseconds; acts as a simple watchdog for long‑running jobs.
- `--max-exec-ms=<n>` – limit each WASM kernel execution to roughly `n` milliseconds; kernels that overrun are killed and flagged as failures (Unix only).
- `--save-model=<path>` / `--load-model=<path>` – persist or restore the
  trainer model between runs (used by `train` and related utilities).

Unrecognised flag values (e.g. `--telemetry-level=foo`) produce a warning
on stderr but do not abort execution; the parser sets a `parseError`
flag that callers may inspect.

These may be passed to `scripts/run.sh` and will be forwarded to the
binary when launched directly.
A helper script `scripts/telemetry_analysis.py` can parse generated
telemetry exports (`gen_*.txt`) and summarise metrics such as mutation
rates, generation durations, and instance counts.  Run it directly or
integrate it into research workflows.
```bash
# GUI is the default; window starts fullscreen
bash scripts/run.sh            # equivalent to --gui

# force headless/terminal mode (no SDL3 window)
bash scripts/run.sh --headless  # also --no-gui / --nogui

# request a windowed UI instead of the fullscreen default
bash scripts/run.sh --windowed

# run and tail logs
bash scripts/run.sh --monitor

The `run.sh` wrapper now prints the full command line it will execute along
with the paths where logs and telemetry will be written.  After a
headless run it also reports the process exit code and shows the last 20
lines of any generated log files, giving immediate feedback without
manually opening files.
```

By default the executable is started with its working directory set to the
build target (e.g. `build/linux-debug`).  However the **actual base path for
logs and telemetry is computed from the executable’s location** so that
running the binary from another directory (including the repo root) still
writes into the build tree.  Files appear under
`<exe_dir>/bin/logs/` and `<exe_dir>/bin/seq/<runid>/` where `<exe_dir>` is
where the bootloader executable lives.  The wrapper script (`run.sh`) changes
into the build directory merely for convenience and to mirror prior
behaviour, but the app no longer depends on the working directory.

The build script prints colored, prefixed `[build]` messages (green for info,
yellow for warnings, red for errors) on top of the usual cmake/ninja output to
make important steps easy to scan.

The test script (`test.sh`) now concludes with a colored summary box
showing total executables run, cumulative assertions and wall‑clock
seconds.  This makes it easy to see at a glance whether the test suite
passed and how long it took.

The `--monitor` option runs the bootloader in the background and tails
`bin/logs/*.log` in real time so you can watch system messages as evolution
proceeds.

### Cleanup

`bash scripts/build.sh --clean` removes the entire `build/` directory along
with CMake/Ninja caches.  It also deletes any generated `bin/` hierarchy at the
repo root, wiping old logs, sequence exports or temporary files produced by
runs or tests.  This leaves the source tree pristine.
