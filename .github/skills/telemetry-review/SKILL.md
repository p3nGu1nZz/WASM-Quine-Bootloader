description: Analyse the runtime logs and telemetry exports produced by the bootloader to spot anomalies, performance issues, or evolution trends. Useful for understanding how the WASM kernel is mutating and when failures occur.

# telemetry-review

## Purpose

Inspect the contents of `build/<target>/bin/logs/` and `build/<target>/bin/seq/<runid>/` directories generated by the bootloader. This skill is helpful after running the application to

- verify that quine outputs and evolution operations are correct
- detect repeated errors or excessive retries
- examine generation reports (gen_<n>.txt) and kernel blobs
- identify missing telemetry fields or faulty exports.

## Typical workflow

1. Run the bootloader with `bash scripts/run.sh --gui` (or headless) and let it execute for a while.
2. Open the newest log file under `build/<target>/bin/logs/` and look for `[error]` or `[warning]` entries.
3. Browse telemetry generations:
   ```sh
   ls build/linux-debug/bin/seq/$(ls build/linux-debug/bin/seq | tail -1)
   head -n 20 gen_1.txt
   ```
4. Verify that each `gen_*.txt` contains a valid Base64 kernel dump and the expected fields (generation, size, timing).
5. Note any anomalies such as missing `VERIFICATION` messages, mutations failing to parse, or the kernel size shrinking unexpectedly.
6. Optionally write a summary or file an issue using your findings.

## Notes

- The telemetry export format is defined in `App::exportHistory()` and may change; keep specs in `docs/specs/spec_telemetry.md` updated accordingly.
- When adding new telemetry fields, run this skill to ensure the data is serialized properly.
